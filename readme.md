## Artem Demo

Hi there!

Thank you for stopping by.
This page is not exactly CV, like HR guys usually expecting to see and this is so, case I don't want it to be public right now. But if you have interesting project, you're more then welcome to write me :)


*Ok, so what do I do?* - I'm frontend developer. I have experience with desktop browsers as well as with mobile.


*What do I prefer?* - It's irrelevant, I like all platforms and I'm happy to develop for all of them: mobile and desktop.


*For which browser versions I developed?* - For desktop everything starting with IE8 (and it's a problem if you want to use modern JS frameworks, but I think you already know it). For mobile everything since Android 2.4


Technologies that I'm familiar with:
* Of course HTML5, CSS3, JS (including ES6)
* JS framework: React (Redux & Flux), Backbone, AngularJS (1 & 2), jQuery
* CSS frameworks: Bootstrap
* Preprocessors: LESS
* Task managers: Gulp, Grunt, Webpack
* Charts: D3
* Server side: PHP, Node.js, MySQL, Apache, Linux (but I'm not backend developer)
